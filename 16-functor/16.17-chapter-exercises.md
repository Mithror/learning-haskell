# Chapter Excercises
## Can a valid Functor be written?
1. No, Bool is of kind `*`
2. Yes, see src/chptexc.hs
3. Yes, see src/chptexc.hs
4. The first f in `outF :: f (Mu f)` implies that f is of kind `* -> *`. `Mu` takes this f to return a type, so it's kind is `(* -> *) -> *`. This means we can't make a Functor from this as this is not `* -> *`
5. No, D is of kind `*`
