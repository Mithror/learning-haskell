# learning-haskell

Hi and welcome!

In this repository you will find my answers for the exercises from the haskell
book: *Haskell programming from first principles.* I give no guarantee as to
the correctness of my solutions, but if you want to compare your solutions to
mine feel free to do so. That's why I made this public after all!

There is one folder for every chapter in the book.

I did most of the exercises using **vs code** and the **hackero** extension.

There is one exercise I have not done (yet?) and that is the last one from
chapter 24 (parser combinations) where you need to parse the *dot language* from
GraphViz. So if you are looking for that specific exercise, you won't find it.
All other exercises should be present though.
