# Exercise: Apply Yourself
1. `myConcat :: [Char] -> [Char] -> [Char]`. The second argument to `(++)` is a `[Char]` and so all types need to be `[Char]`.
2. `myMult :: Fractional a => a -> a`. The `(/)` requires the `Fractional` typeclass (which is a subset of the `Num` class.)
3. `myTake :: Int -> [Char] -> [Char]`. Same reason a (1)
4. `myCom :: Int -> Bool`. Second argument of `(<)` is `Int`, which inherits the `Ord` typeclass so we no longer need to specify it.
5. `myAlph :: Char -> Bool`.
