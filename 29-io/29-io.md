# 29 IO

## 29.9 Chapter Exercises

### File I/O with VigenÃ¨re

see [src/Vigenere.hs](./src/Vigenere.hs)

```shell
> echo "this is a test!" | ./Vigenere -e blah | ./Vigenere -d blah
this is a test!
```

### Add timeouts to your utility

see [src/Vigenere.hs](./src/Vigenere.hs)

The `hWaitForInput` does not work so well though. It needs a newline to not
timeout. Or, of course, an EOF.

### Config Directories

see [src/IniDir.hs](./src/IniDir.hs)

There are some bugs in my parser (e.g. comments after values), but the logic
of checking the dirctory works!
