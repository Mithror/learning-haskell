# Exercises: Guard Duty
## Exercise 1
If you start with the `otherwise` statement, all grades will be F's.

## Exercise 2
It will still work, but the result won't be as expected. E.g. if you move `| y >= 0.9 = 'A'` below the B grade, then any grade of 80 or higher will be a B, because `0.9 >= 0.8` is true and thus it matches with the grade for B.

## Exercise 3
(b)

## Exercise 4
`[a]`

## Exercise 5
`pal :: [a] -> Bool`

## Exercise 6
(c)

## Exercise 7
`Ord a => a`

## Exercise 8
`numbers :: (Ord a, Num a, Num b) => a -> b`
