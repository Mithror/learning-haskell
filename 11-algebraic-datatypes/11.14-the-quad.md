# Exercises: The Quad
# Exercise 1
`Either` is a sum type, so `eQuad` has `4 + 4 = 8` inhabitants.

# Exercise 2
`(,)` is a product type, so `prodQuad` has `4 * 4 = 16` inhabitants.

# Exercise 3
`(->)` is an exponential type, so `funcQuad` has `4 ^ 4 = 256` inhabitants.

# Exercise 4
`(,,)` is a product type, so `prodTBool` has `2 * 2 * 2 = 8` inhabitants.

# Exercise 5
`(->)` is an exponential type, so `gTwo` has `(2 ^ 2) ^ 2 = 16` inhabitants.

# Exercise 6
`(->)` is an exponential type, so `fTwo` has `(4 ^ 4) ^ 2 = 65536` inhabitants.
