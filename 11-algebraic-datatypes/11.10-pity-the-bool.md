# Exercises: Pity the Bool
## Exercise 1
The cardinality here is 4: `[Big False, Big True, Small False, Small True]`

## Exercise 2
Cardinality of `Numba` is 256 (same as `Int8`).
Cardinality of `Bool` is 2.
Cardinality of `NumberOrBool` is `256 + 2 = 258`

If you try to create a `Numba` with numeric literals larger than 127 or smaller than  (-128) you will get an error as the number will be higher than what can be contained in an `Int8`
