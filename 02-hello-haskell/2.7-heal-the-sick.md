# Exercises: Heal the Sick
# Excercise 1
The space between 3. and 14 should be removed.

`let area x = 3.14 * (x * x)`

# Exercise 2
b is unknown is this definition, unless previously defined. The former will generate and error, the latter won't, but the intent of the function is to double the input, so `b` should be replaced by `x`

`let double x = x * 2`

# Exercise 3
The line should start at the same indentation.

```
x = 7
y = 10
f = x + y
```
