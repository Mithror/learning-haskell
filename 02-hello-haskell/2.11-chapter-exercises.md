# Parenthesization
1. `(2 + (2 * 3)) - 1`
2. `(^) 10 (1 + 1)`
3. `((2 ^ 2) * (4 ^ 5)) + 1`

# Equivalent expressions
1. Equivalent.
2. Equivalent.
3. Different. `(-) 37 400` is equal to `37 - 400`
4. Different. Integer division versus real division.
5. Different. Multiplication has higher precedence.

# More fun with functions
In the REPL:

`let z = 7; x = y ^ 2; waxOn = x * 5; y = z + 8`

1. `waxOn` is a number equal to `1125`. So it would be as if you replace `waxOn` by `1125`.
2. /
3. This will return `1125 * 3` or `3375`
4. see src/chapter.hs

6. see src/chapter.hs
7. waxOff is  basically an for the triple function.
