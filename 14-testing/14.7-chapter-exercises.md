## Validating numbers into words
see src/wordnumbertest.hs

## Using QuickCheck
see src/proptest.hs

## Failure
This will fill due to precision. `sqrt 2` cannot be accurately represented, so it is rounded to a ration number. This rounding error causes a different when squaring it.

## Idempotence
see src/idempotence.hs

## Hangman testing
see hangman/test/tests.hs

## Validating ciphers
No code available, but the principle is easy:
1. Create generator for the input (limited to a-z and A-Z)
2. Create generator for the caesar key (limited to 0-25)
3. Create generator for vigenere key (limited to a-z)
4. quickCheck the properties that decode after encode is the identity
