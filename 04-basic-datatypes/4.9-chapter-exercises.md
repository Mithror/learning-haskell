# Chapter Exercises

1. `length :: [a] -> Int` (Why not `Integer`?)
2. Answers:
   1. 5
   2. 3
   3. 2
   4. 5
3. `(/)` takes two `Fractional` types. `length` returns and `Int` which is not `Fractional`. (`Float` and `Double` are)
4. Use `div` instead: `div 6 $ length [1, 2, 3]`
5. `Bool`. `True` (Note: `(+)` has higher precedence)
6. `Bool`. `False`
7. Answers:
    1. Works. `Bool`. `True`
    2. Won't work. List needs to have elements of the same type.
    3. Works. `Int`. `5`
    4. Works. `Bool`. `False`
    5. Won't work. `(&&)` needs two `Bool`'s, `9` isn't one.
